## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS and SCSS for dark mode functionality
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) - Personally call it an add-on JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Firebase ](https://firebase.google.com) - For the Backend


### What I learned

This is my first project with TypeScript and Firebase basically. I learnt a lot working with both technologies, type safety in TypeScript, which makes my code more strict and type safe. I also learned how to use TypeScript in React which was the most interesting part. 

I learnt about Firebase's authentication process here. I also explored Firebase Cloudstore, which was the main feature that was the main composition of this project. I learnt about collections and documents and how to update the Firestore database real-time.


### Continued development

I looked forward to building more projects with TypeScript and more Firebase features, and also improve my web accessibility skills. Next project will be built in a Next.js environment. No pun intended, haha  


### Useful resources

- [TypeScript's Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Firebase Documentation](https://www.firebase.google.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) ofcourse!
